# Mansi_Potfolio-
This is my personal portfolio website built using tech stack, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. It showcases my skills, projects, resume, and contact information. The goal of this site is to present myself professionally to potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work.
